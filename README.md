## Ukraine OSINT Project
This project works with Obsidian and the plug in Digital Obsidian Garden. It is currently in progress. I'll update as time allows.

Hello. Glad you could make it.
On February 24, 2022, Russia invaded the sovereign nation of Ukraine giving any number of crazy excuses for their invasion, brutality, rape, looting, cultural genocide and indiscriminate slaughter of civilians and children.
Due to this, the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Community has come together, combining specialties and tools in support of Ukraine. Sometimes, it takes a village.

This is the template to be used together with the [Digital Garden Obsidian Plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden). 
See the README in the plugin repo for information on how to set it up.

## Custom Styling
I encourage you to change the default styling to make the site your own. Please modify the custom-style.scss when doing so to avoid future conflict when updating the template.
